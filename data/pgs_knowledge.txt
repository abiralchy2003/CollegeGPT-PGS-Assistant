Admission process
The admission journey at Presidential Graduate School, in academic partnership with Westcliff University, is intentionally personalized, reflective, and empowering—designed to understand students' academic potential, professional goals, and readiness to contribute as future global leaders. Each step of the process is structured to offer clarity, support, and engagement from the moment a student expresses interest to the final university enrollment.
1. Initial Counseling Session with Admissions Team
●	The admission journey begins with a personal and meaningful one-on-one interaction with our experienced academic counselors. This initial step is designed to help you gain clarity and confidence about your educational path. You can choose to connect with our counselors in the way that’s most convenient for you—whether it’s by visiting us in person, making a phone call, or chatting via WhatsApp. We are always accessible and ready to support you at any of the following contact numbers: +977 9767658631, +977 9851343705, and +977 9851343905.

During your session with the counselor, you’ll receive personalized guidance tailored to your academic background and career aspirations. You’ll learn about the different program options we offer, the academic pathways available to you, and how your goals can align with our offerings. This is also your opportunity to explore potential scholarship opportunities and understand the selection process involved. Our counselors will walk you through what documents you’ll need, the steps in the application timeline, and any additional support available. This conversation is more than just an information session—it sets the tone for a smooth and informed admission journey by giving you a clear understanding of what to expect and how to move forward with confidence.
2. Inquiry Form Submission
Once you've had your initial conversation with our admissions counselor and feel confident about moving forward, the next step is to fill out our Inquiry Form. This is a simple yet important document that allows us to formally capture your interest in the program. By providing your background, academic history, and career goals, you're helping us get to know you better so we can guide you more effectively. This form also ensures that you receive important updates about scholarships, deadlines, program announcements, and other relevant opportunities tailored to your profile. It’s your way of saying, “I’m ready to explore what comes next,” and it helps us stay connected throughout your admission journey.
3. Participation in Case Study Trivia and Interview Round
After submitting the Inquiry Form, you’ll be invited to participate in two exciting and important components of the selection process: the Case Study Trivia and the Interview Session. The Case Study Trivia is designed to be both engaging and thought-provoking. It’s not a traditional test—it’s more of a challenge that lets us see how you approach real-world scenarios. We’re interested in your problem-solving techniques, your logical thinking, and how you express your ideas. It’s also an opportunity for you to showcase your creative and analytical abilities, which are valuable skills in any graduate program.
	Following this, you’ll attend a Meet & Greet Interview with a faculty representative. This is a more personal and reflective session where we aim to understand you better as an individual. During the interview, we’ll talk about your academic journey, your motivation for joining the program, and your future plans. It’s an open, friendly conversation meant to ensure that there’s a good match between your goals and what our institution can offer. Both the trivia and the interview play a role in evaluating your scholarship eligibility, so it’s a great chance to stand out.

Both the trivia and the interview play a role in evaluating your scholarship eligibility, so it’s a great chance to stand out.
5. Admission Fee Clearance
Once the application form is complete and reviewed, the next step is to clear the admission fee. This payment officially secures your spot in the incoming class and enables us to move forward with your university enrollment. Our team will provide you with clear instructions regarding the payment amount and the different options available, such as bank deposit, eSewa, or direct payment at our campus. We also offer support for any questions you may have about the process or technical aspects of making the payment. Once the transaction is confirmed, you’ll receive a receipt and be officially considered an admitted student.
6. Westcliff University Enrollment
The final step in your admission process is completing the Online Enrollment Form for Westcliff University, our prestigious academic partner. This form is essential for finalizing your enrollment in the graduate program. You’ll receive direct guidance from our admissions department on how to access and complete the form, along with instructions on uploading the required digital documents. These may include scanned versions of your academic credentials, identification documents, and any additional items specific to your program. Our team is committed to walking you through this step-by-step to ensure there are no hiccups and everything is submitted correctly and on time.

Student Services
At Presidential Graduate School, our mission extends far beyond academics. We believe in nurturing the whole individual—mind, body, and character. Our Student Services are thoughtfully curated to support every dimension of student growth, from hands-on international experiences to communication mastery, corporate exposure, and character development. Here's a comprehensive look at how we ensure our students graduate not only with a degree but with a wealth of experience and confidence.
●	International Internship
	As a dynamic part of the Digital Transformation (DT) session, our students are given the remarkable opportunity to intern in organizations across India. These international internships offer first-hand exposure to real-world professional environments and allow students to apply their skills on projects that matter.
Currently, our students are engaged in advanced domains such as web development and Metaverse projects, making them early participants in future technologies. These internships are not just add-ons—they are pivotal experiences that shape our students' global perspectives, cross-cultural awareness, and readiness for the international job market.
●	Digital Transformation Session
	The Digital Transformation (DT) session is a 10-month learning journey created for undergraduate students. This unique module is aimed at introducing students to the evolving landscape of digital business transformation.
Classes are held twice a month and are led by corporate leaders who have played instrumental roles in digitizing various organizations. Students gain an in-depth understanding of technologies such as Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, and how these tools are used to revolutionize traditional business models.
The DT session serves as both an academic and professional immersion, helping students witness first-hand how digital innovation reshapes the world around us.
●	Guest Speaker Sessions
	At Presidential, we deeply value experiential learning and personal stories of growth. That’s why we regularly host Guest Speaker Sessions, inviting accomplished individuals from a wide range of fields—from business and politics to arts and science.
These sessions offer students the chance to interact directly with influential figures, ask questions, and reflect on their journeys. More than lectures, these are conversations—ones that inspire critical thinking, self-awareness, and career motivation.
●	ECA/CCA – Extra/Co-Curricular Activities
At Presidential, education is holistic. That’s why we actively promote Extra and Co-Curricular Activities (ECA/CCA) to enhance student life beyond the classroom. Students participate in an exciting calendar of events such as:
●	Sports Week

●	The Job Placement Cell at Presidential Graduate School

That’s why we’ve established the Job Placement Cell (JPC)—a dynamic support system dedicated to connecting our graduates with meaningful career and internship opportunities in Nepal’s most respected companies and organizations. The JPC isn't just a department—it’s a career catalyst designed to bridge the gap between classroom learning and real-world application.
The core mission of the Job Placement Cell is to create and nurture long-term partnerships with leading corporate and media houses across Nepal. These partnerships are carefully developed to ensure our students have access to valuable internships and job placements, aligned with their academic background and career ambitions. We operate on a foundational belief: knowledge gained through business and IT education must be put into action through hands-on experiences in professional environments. Without practical exposure, even the best academic learning can fall short in producing the industry leaders and tech innovators of tomorrow.
Our Job Placement Cell is staffed with approachable and professional career advisors who are dedicated to your personal success. They don’t just facilitate placements—they also provide career counseling, resume support, interview coaching, and guidance on building a professional presence.

The history of these clubs is that there was only one club, which was the IT club. However, it was difficult to manage because of different sector interests and a lot of members, so it was divided into four clubs, each focusing on one specific sector. All IT clubs were established in 2023 between June and September. These clubs actively organize events that can be collaborative from all IT clubs like code competition and is focused on innovation, competitions, and hands-on learning.
